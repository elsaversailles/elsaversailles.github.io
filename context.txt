ARTERION INC. IS COMMITTED
to providing a work environment for all staff that is free from sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment. Staff are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to show respect for their team members.

Arterion lnc.'s commitment begins with the recognition and acknowledgment that sexual harassment and other types of discriminatory harassment are, of course, unlawful.

To reinforce this commitment, Arterion Inc. has developed a policy against harassment and a reporting procedure for employees who have been subjected to or witnessed harassment. This policy applies to all work­ related settings and activities, whether inside or outside the work environment, and includes any activity or operations under Arterion Inc., Arterion Philippines, and all of its subsidiaries.



• • • • • •






Arterion lnc.'s property, or any platform that bears the name of the organization may not be used to engage in conduct that violates this policy. Arterion lnc.'s policy against harassment covers staff and other individuals who are under Arterion Inc., Arterion Philippines, and all of its subsidiaries which enables the Human Resource Department to exercise some control over the individual's conduct in places and activities that relate to Arterion lnc.'s work (e.g. directors, officers, staff, partners, volunteers, etc.).

ARTERION INC.'S POLICY AGAINST
sexual harassment prohibits sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature, when:

submission to such conduct is made an express or implicit condition of any applicable favor;

submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for decisions affecting the individual who submits to or rejects such conduct; or

such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with any work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating, or offensive working environment.







• • • • • •



While it is not possible to list all of the circumstances which would constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples:

unwelcome sexual advances -- whether they involve physical touching or not;
0	requests for sexual favors in exchange for any personal or work-related; or
0	coerced sexual acts.

Depending on the circumstances, the following conduct may also constitute sexual harassment:

use of sexual epithets, jokes, written or oral references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding one's sex life;

sexually oriented comment on an individual's body, comment about an individual's sexual activity, deficiencies, or prowess;
0	displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons;
unwelcome leering, whistling, deliberate brushing against the body in a suggestive manner;
0	sexual gestures or sexually suggestive comments;
0	inquiries into one's sexual experiences; or
0	discussion of one's sexual activities.






• • • • • •



While such behavior, depending on the circumstances, may not be severe or pervasive enough to create a sexually hostile work environment, it can nonetheless make the personnel uncomfortable. Accordingly, such behavior is inappropriate and may result in disciplinary action regardless of whether it is unlawful.

It is also unlawful and expressly against Arterion Inc. policy to retaliate against a staff for filing a complaint of sexual harassment or for cooperating with an investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment.
